# KEY SMASHER

## Description

A so called 'game' in which everybody can test his speed, typing speed, to be precise. All you have to do is typing AS FAST AS YOU CAN the text given. At the end, a score will be given representing your speed.

## Features

### Armed timer

A 60 seconds timer is armed when pressing your first key, in charge of counting down and calculating how many words you can enter.

### The MISTAKE CHECKER

With a fancy name, an algorithm handling every word after 'Spacebar' key has been hit. This one will keep track of the number of right/wrong words typed. To test its correctiveness, every word is color coded as to represent if it was a CORRECT type or NOT

### Backspace ENABLED

If by any chance you might wanna correct a mistake, this function will let you do it. Keeping in mind that WRONG typing will not be forgotten, a mistake partially corrected is a good way to go with.

### FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS

Your current word is more important. We know that, and in order to help you, a focus function will remind you what you need to type. Keep in mind that a wrong character will make the focus RED, so be careful

### Displaying your score

60 seconds were given, let's see your score. Your statistics will be shown. Ready?

## THE LONG WAY:

-Generating new 30 words after 30 were typed(halfway there)
-Implement a way to import new words using an API;
-Creating a user profile where you can save your score;
-Different challenges to test your skills;
-A better, much better UI.
