#Let's play BlackJack

##Description

A plain, simple project that consists of a game of Blackjack.
The game starts when hitting "start game", where 2 cards are being given from 2-11, using a random function. If the sum of those 2 isnt't 21, you get to choose if you wanna add draw another card. If it exceeds 21, the draw button becomes disabled, and you need to start again.

##Future steps: - Adding the cards of the dealer, alongside with the logic - A way to store data of the player, alongside with his chips - Better styling and indenting
-Animations
-A "highscore" of streaks against the dealer
